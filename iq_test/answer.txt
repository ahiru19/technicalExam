Question 1:

My answer is number 2 because of the image, we can see that it is following a pattern that will look like a separated asterisk and its circling around a small astrisek.

Question 2:
My answer will also be number 2 because the first row, it tells us that the image is getting bigger but because of the second column of the first row that is hidden, we dont know if it is rotating or not while the second row is confirming to us that the image is really getting bigger in each column and lastly the 3rd row is saying that the shapes are not rotating but rather their are just getting bigger.

Question 3:

My answer will be number 3. because just like the the first and second row, the pattern is just putting them together, they dont have the same lines inside of themselves and the 1st column of each row is telling us the first on the left or on bottom, while the second column is telling us the one on top or on the right of it.

Question 4:

My answer is number 4, because the pattern of the circle and square is downward while the pattern of the line is always the same in each column. while the pattern of the circle and square is changing, their colors also alternates.

Question 5:

I would choose number 3 because the circle is moving always in diagonal position from lower right to upper right while the the square is different position from each rows. and we can determine its position if it is on the upper right or upper left from the pattern that is existing in the first two rows if you look at it in a downward point of view
